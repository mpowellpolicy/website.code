I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the [Harry S Truman School of Government & Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri.  I currently possess a B.A. in Political Science, with a minor in biology from Truman State University, as well as a Masterâ€™s in Public Affairs and a Juris Doctor from the University of Missouri.  Between my graduation from law school and my return to academia, I was a nonprofit executive and attorney working in the conservation land trust sector for nearly a decade, protecting vital natural resources using conservation easements and fee title acquisition, and serving as a leader for the land trust community at both the state and national levels.

After nearly a decade as a conservation professional, I returned to the University of Missouri to pursue studies in comparative environmental policy at the Truman School of Government and Public Affairs.  I am interested in the intersections between humans, ecology, and land use, as well as comparative political study more broadly, with a focus on democracy and the unintended consequences of policy action.

You can download a copy of my Curriculum Vitae {{< staticref "Powell_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

I was born and raised in the state of Missouri, but have lived in Vermont and Ohio, and have close personal and professional ties to Germany.  I am fluent in English and conversational in German (CEFR B1).  When not engaged in academic pursuits, I can often be found enjoying punk and folk music from across the world, reading voraciously, and spending time outdoors with my wife and dog.
